# Changelog

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **UnicodeDecodeError during install**: Subprocesses launched with `text=True` decoded their output strictly, so a single non-UTF-8 byte from a child process (e.g. a `huggingface_hub`/`tqdm` progress bar written in a non-UTF-8 Windows console code page) aborted the whole install with `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa2`. All subprocess and text-file reads now pin `encoding="utf-8"` with `errors="replace"`.

### Changed

- **Computer restart reminder**: The Python install prompt now tells Windows users to restart their computer (not just Blender) after installing Python 3.12, so the updated PATH takes effect.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **PyTorch install on Python 3.13**: The cu121 index has no Python 3.13 wheels; the installer now detects the Python version and uses cu124 (PyTorch 2.6+) for Python 3.13.
- **PyTorch install on Blackwell GPUs (RTX 50xx)**: cu121/cu124 wheels only compile kernels for up to sm_90. RTX 50xx cards (sm_120+) caused a `no kernel image is available` CUDA error at runtime. The installer now detects GPU compute capability via `nvidia-smi` and selects cu128 (PyTorch 2.7+) for Blackwell.

### Added

- **Delete Venv button**: A trash icon button now appears at the bottom of the Connection panel after a successful install, so the venv can be wiped and reinstalled from the UI without going to the terminal. A confirmation popup prevents accidental deletion.

### Removed

- **`kimodo_textencoder --device cpu` tip**: The command did not work reliably and Kimodo runs fine on lower-VRAM cards without it.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Rest-orientation-invariant joint rotations**: Joint rotation extraction now accounts for the rest orientation of each bone, so retargeted motion is correct even when the source armature is not in a canonical rest pose (previously rotations could be offset by the bone's rest transform).
- **Hand / foot effector constraints targeting hips**: Hand and foot spatial constraints were incorrectly sending the effector target to the hips bone instead of the wrist/ankle end-effector. Fixed so each constraint type maps to the correct bone.
- **Full-Body constraint re-enabled**: The Full-Body pose constraint (pose a reference armature to set a full joint-pose keyframe) was inadvertently disabled; it is now re-enabled. Duplicate pose markers are also frozen to prevent accidental edits.

### Changed

- **Default retarget mode is now "Child Of"**: New bone-mapping entries default to the *Child Of* constraint instead of *Copy Rotation*, which produces better full-body results out of the box for most rigs.

### Added

- **`blender_manifest.toml`**: Added the Blender 4.2+ extension-system manifest so the addon can be installed via the new Extensions platform (`.zip` install and legacy Add-ons path both still work).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Desktop-launch compatibility**: Blender launched from a desktop environment (via `.desktop` file, app menu, or file manager) inherits a stripped PATH from the display manager — standard tools like `pip`, `venv`, `git`, and `nvidia-smi` were not found, breaking the installer. A `_build_env()` helper now ensures every subprocess spawned by the plugin receives a complete PATH (including `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, etc.) and a valid `HOME`, regardless of how Blender was started.
- **Python detection in desktop sessions**: `_find_system_python()` now probes known install directories (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.pyenv/shims`) in addition to `shutil.which`, so Python interpreters installed outside the display manager's minimal PATH are still discovered.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Windows improvements

- **Python detection**: Skip Windows App Execution Alias stubs (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps`) that point to the Store instead of a real interpreter, preventing broken venv creation.
- **Python install prompt**: When no Python 3.10+ is found, the Connection panel shows a prominent download button linking directly to the Python 3.12 Windows installer, with instructions to tick "Add Python to PATH" and run as Administrator.
- **Python 3.13 support**: Python 3.13 is now accepted alongside 3.10–3.12.
- **Architecture-aware installer link**: The download button serves the `arm64` installer on ARM machines and `amd64` everywhere else.
- **Git-less install fallback**: When `git` is not on `PATH`, Kimodo and kimodo-viser are installed via GitHub's zip-archive endpoint instead of `git+https://`, so the installer works on stock Windows without Git.
- **Partial/broken venv recovery**: A sentinel file (`.kimodo_install_complete`) is written only on successful install. On the next session, any venv missing the sentinel is treated as broken and wiped on retry — no more silent failures after a mid-install crash.
- **NVIDIA GPU gate**: The install button is disabled and a clear error is shown when no NVIDIA GPU is detected (`nvidia-smi` not found or returns no GPUs). AMD/Intel users see an explicit "not supported" message instead of a cryptic CUDA error later.
- **GPU check on Start**: Clicking *Start Kimodo* also checks for a CUDA-capable GPU and fails fast with a readable error if none is found.
- **Blender restart reminder**: After the Python installer download prompt, the panel reminds users to restart Blender before clicking *Retry Install*.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **One-click auto-installer** (`setup_operator.py`): A new *Install Kimodo (Auto)* button in the Connection panel handles the full setup without any terminal work:
  - Creates a managed Python venv at `~/.kimodo-venv/`
  - Installs PyTorch (CUDA 12.1) and the [Aero-Ex offline fork](https://github.com/Aero-Ex/kimodo) of Kimodo, including a pre-built `motion_correction` wheel (no MSVC / CMake required on Windows)
  - Installs the [NVIDIA kimodo-viser fork](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/kimodo-viser) which provides `viser._timeline_api` (not available in PyPI viser)
  - Installs all undeclared Kimodo dependencies discovered by source audit: `bitsandbytes`, `safetensors`, `psutil`
  - Downloads the `Aero-Ex/KIMODO-Meta3_llm2vec_NF4` LLM2Vec text-encoder model locally and patches `llm2vec_wrapper.py` so it loads from disk
  - Downloads `nvidia/Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1` model weights into the HF cache
  - Auto-fills the Python path field on completion
  - Shows live progress in the Connection panel; full log printed to the system console with `[Kimodo Install]` prefix
  - Failed installs show a *Retry Install* button that wipes the partial venv and starts clean

- **Offline operation**: After the initial install, Kimodo runs with no internet access. The bridge subprocess is launched with `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` and `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1` when the managed venv is detected.

- **Bridge console logging**: All output from `bridge_server.py` (PyTorch errors, loading progress, model ready) is now streamed to the system console with a `[Kimodo Bridge]` prefix, making startup failures easy to diagnose.

- **Use Installed Kimodo** button: If the managed venv exists but the Python path is not set, a one-click button sets it automatically.

### Changed

- Connection panel now shows a contextual install section at the top: install prompt → live progress → completion/error state, depending on installer state.
- Failed bridge startup now reports the process exit code and directs the user to the console instead of showing a truncated stderr snippet.
