A Blender addon that generates AI-driven human motion via [NVIDIA Kimodo](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/kimodo) and imports it directly into your scene — no copy-pasting, no manual BVH wrangling.

## How it works

Blender's embedded Python cannot load PyTorch or Kimodo directly. The addon solves this with a two-process bridge:

```
Blender (addon)                Kimodo venv
  subprocess_client.py  ─────▶  bridge_server.py
                        ◀─────  (model loaded once, handles requests)
```

The bridge server loads the Kimodo model once at startup and then responds to generation requests over stdin/stdout. Blender stays responsive while generation runs in a background thread.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Blender 4.0+ | Tested on 5.1 (Windows & Arch Linux) |
| Python 3.10–3.12 | System Python used to create the managed venv |
| NVIDIA GPU | 8 GB+ VRAM recommended; 16 GB+ for best results |
| CUDA | Must match your PyTorch build (CUDA 12.1 installed by default) |
| ~10 GB disk | For the managed venv, model weights, and LLM2Vec encoder |

> **Low VRAM?** Run `kimodo_textencoder --device cpu` in a separate terminal with the Kimodo venv activated. This offloads the text encoder to CPU and frees several GB of VRAM.

---

## Installation

As of v1.2.0 Kimodo installs itself automatically — no terminal required. The addon is also compatible with the Blender 4.2+ Extensions platform (includes `blender_manifest.toml`).

### 1 — Install the Blender addon

1. Download or clone this repository (top-right **Code → Download ZIP**).
2. Open Blender → **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk…**
3. Select the downloaded zip and enable **"Kimodo Motion Generator"**.

### 2 — Click "Install Kimodo (Auto)"

Open the **Kimodo** N-Panel tab (press `N` in the 3D Viewport), expand **Connection**, and click **Install Kimodo (Auto)**.

The installer will:
- Create a managed Python venv at `~/.kimodo-venv/`
- Install PyTorch (CUDA 12.1), all Kimodo dependencies, and the [Aero-Ex offline fork](https://github.com/Aero-Ex/kimodo)
- Download the LLM2Vec text-encoder model locally and patch it for offline use
- Download the `Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1` model weights into the HF cache
- Set the Python path automatically when done

Progress is shown live in the Connection panel. The full log is printed to the system console (launch Blender from a terminal, or on Windows use **Window → Toggle System Console**).

> **Requires:** Python 3.10–3.12 on your system PATH, internet access, and ~10 GB of free disk space. After the initial install, Kimodo runs fully offline.

### Manual installation (advanced)

If you already have Kimodo installed in your own venv, skip the auto-installer and paste the path to your venv Python into the **Kimodo Python** field in the Connection panel.

## Quick Start

### Generate motion from a text prompt

1. **Start** the bridge: click **Start Kimodo** in the Connection panel.  
   The status line will show *Loading model…* then *Ready* once the model is loaded (this takes 10–60 s the first time).

2. Open the **Motion Segments** panel.

3. Click **Add** to create a segment, type a prompt (e.g. `a person jogs in a circle`), and set the frame range.

4. Click **Generate Selected** (one segment) or **Generate All** (all enabled segments in one model call with smooth transitions).

5. A `Kimodo_Source` armature will appear in your scene with the generated motion applied.

> **30 FPS tip:** Kimodo always generates at 30 FPS. If your scene is set to a different frame rate, an alert will appear above the generate buttons with a **Set to 30 FPS** button.

### Use multiple segments

Each segment is an independent text prompt mapped to a frame range. **Generate All** sends every enabled segment to Kimodo in a single model call, producing one continuous animation with smooth transitions between prompts.

- Segments are listed in order. The **Start** frame of each segment after the first is automatically locked to the **End** frame of the previous segment — just drag the End frame and the next segment's Start updates automatically.
- Use **Duplicate** to copy a segment and place it immediately after.
- Use **↑ / ↓** to reorder segments.

### Retarget to your own rig

After generating motion you can drive any armature from the Kimodo source:

1. Open the **Retarget** panel.
2. Set **Source** to `Kimodo_Source` and **Target** to your character rig.
3. Click **Auto-Match Bones** — the addon fuzzy-matches Kimodo bone names against your rig.
4. Review the mapping, enable/disable pairs, choose a retarget mode per bone. Its recommended to also adjust the scale of the armature to match your character and then applying it with CTRL+A.
5. Choose the type of constraint the plugin should use, "Child of", "Copy Rotation" etc...
6. Click **Apply Constraints** — Blender constraint drivers are added to your rig.
7. Click **Bake & Remove Constraints** when you are happy — keyframes are baked onto your rig and all Kimodo constraints are removed, leaving a clean, self-contained animation.

Use **Save / Load Preset** to store bone mappings for a rig and reuse them later.

### Motion constraints

Spatial goals can be given to Kimodo so the generated motion passes through specific positions:

| Constraint | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Root XZ | Where the character's root lands on the ground plane |
| Full-Body | A full joint-pose keyframe (pose a reference armature) |
| Left / Right Hand | Wrist end-effector position |
| Left / Right Foot | Foot / heel end-effector position |

To add a constraint:
1. Move the 3D cursor (or select an armature) to the desired position.
2. Set the timeline to the target frame.
3. In the **Motion Constraints** panel, click the constraint type.

**Auto-Origin** (off by default) shifts all constraint positions so the earliest root waypoint lands at Kimodo's world origin — author constraints anywhere in your scene without worrying about absolute coordinates.

## Troubleshooting

**Bridge won't start / "Failed to start"**
- Check the system console for `[Kimodo Bridge]` lines — the full Python/PyTorch error is printed there.
- Check that the Python path points to the venv Python that has Kimodo installed.
- If you used the auto-installer and it failed partway through, click **Retry Install** — it will wipe the partial venv and start clean.

**CUDA out of memory**
- Use a shorter duration or fewer segments.

**Retargeted rig is in the wrong pose**
- Try a different retarget mode per bone (Copy Rotation vs Copy Transforms vs Child Of).
- Make sure the source and target armatures are both in their rest pose / have the same pose before trying the retargeting, and have scale applied on the armature.

**Frames from imorted animation dont match**
- Kimodo generates at exactly 30 FPS. Use the **Set to 30 FPS** button that appears in the Motion Segments panel when your scene is at a different frame rate.
